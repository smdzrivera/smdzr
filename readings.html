            <h1>Reading reflections week 1</h1>
                <p>
                    I really liked the idea from Rules of Play about video games 
                    being unproductive, in the sense that they don’t generate profit 
                    or material wealth for the player. Instead, they create a space 
                    for experiences that exist outside of economic gain -—time reserved 
                    purely for play, exploration, and imagination. This idea of 
                    unproductiveness feels meaningful because it values the experience 
                    itself, not what it can produce or achieve. It reminds me of the 
                    Account of the Peach Blossom Spring, where the fisherman finds a 
                    hidden utopia but can never return to it. Like video games, the 
                    Peach Blossom Spring isn’t about owning or gaining something tangible;
                    it’s about the fleeting, transformative experience it offers. Even though
                    neither the game nor the utopia can be fully captured or held onto, they 
                    leave behind something powerful—a memory, a feeling, or an inspiration 
                    that stays with you. Both show how some of the most meaningful experiences
                    in life are the ones that can’t be measured or commodified, but still move
                    us in profound ways.
