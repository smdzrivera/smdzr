    //variables are containers for storing data values.

    // let - local - limited to code block, statement or expression
    // var - global - can be accessed outside the declaration scope
    // const - unchanging value - constant - same value through the life of the variable
    //const must be assigned a value when declared
    /*
    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter
    Names can also begin with $ and _
    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names; they will throw syntax error
