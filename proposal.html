    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    
    <p>What I would like to do for this class<p/>

<p>I would like to work on a videogame that has a narrative centered on debt.<p/>

<p>I would like to relate this project with my Site, Sound, Process, Place class project which includes a site specific research process.<p/>

<p>I would like to work with very specific prompts. For one reason or another (tbd with further research), the main character is at a station or terminal (space station, bus station, airport, etc) and has a desire to move away but can’t because they have no money. So begins exploring space. Gets a loitering ticket, starts seeing negative balance on UI. I would like to explore with this idea of negative balance and how this changes the characters goals or desires. They need to get tokens that are hidden around the place or from some of the arcade machines in the space. The arcade machines have very basic 2d games with titles like “can you commodify it?” where you have to yassify rare earth minerals or “banana republic” where you have to set rail tracks for the train that will extract bananas from a third world nation so that you can feed your nation (or maybe just collect bananas if it’s too complicated). These 2d arcade games provide tokens for the character, along with few real money and other tokens they can find scattered and hidden in the environment. When after a while they convert the tokens to real money they get frustrated because of the conversion rate.<p/>

<p>Poor aesthetic and priority on quality of sound landscape and research process.<p/>

<p>Concretely for this class:<p/>

<p>Narrative centered on desires in conflict with  debt and absurd economic rules in an ironic and satiric way<p/>

<ul>
<li>Build a skeleton or outline of the basic scenes of the game.</li>
<li>Engage in class readings + research on debt (condition of indebted man)</li>
<li>Explore sound landscapes</li>
<li>Flowchart for beginning of game</li>
<li>Layout, modelling and some texturing for at least main scene of the game in Unity</li>
</ul>
